Nosso site é um site para expor ocorrências sobre energia⚡.


Nosso ControllerLayer🧑‍💻 foi feito com flask (framework da linguagem python🐍)
Ou seja, nosso backend faz verificações com metodos do flask💫.
Temos o intuito de expor todas as ocorrências com os nomes dos respectivos usuários na pagina principal.


We are a group of six brazilian students of ComputerScience⚛️, and we are developing a website to register eletrical issues.
Our first contact with this framework, so that website can be not good at all.👌

The front-end⚛️ was developed by 3 of ours students, the another 2 are responsable to conduict the ideias💡, like a boss and they are the responsables for show our project for the professor.
I was the main back-end🔤 developer but we also help each other, i had a lot of help with the back-end and also i help the front-end.
